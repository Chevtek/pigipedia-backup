### The "teacup" myth.

Just wanted to remind everyone that the terms “micro”, “teacup”, and adding “mini” in front of a breed that is already a mini pig are terms that unethical breeders have made up. Why? Because they sell more baby pigs and make more money.

They will also say things like, “it depends on how much you feed them for how big they get”. You wouldn’t say this about a kitten, puppy, or toddler, because it doesn’t make sense. Pig’s are no different. They are going to be as big as they are going to be, and yes, they can get overweight(like any animal or human), but you can’t change bone structure or size. Pig’s absolutely love food, and depriving them of it makes them unhealthy and miserable, and can even cause behavioral issues... I know I get hangry when I haven’t eaten enough! Pig’s that are deprived of nutrition often only live a few short years. A healthy, well taken care of pig can live up to 20 years! Again, breeders know that people are becoming more educated about pig’s, so they say these things trying to convince potential buyers that the pig’s they sell won’t get “big”.

Another breeder lie that is going around is that a certain breed of mini pig only grows for 3 years. This is simply not true. Most pig’s are a mix of different breeds anyways. All pig’s will grow until they are 5. You usually see the most growth in the first 3 years, but they aren’t completely done until 5. They will have growth spurts at different times, just like human’s, so even if they are still on the smaller side at 3, they could potentially have a growth spurt. 

### Knowledge is power!

I urge all of you to arm yourself with it so we can shut down these breeders spreading lies. If you see people using these terms or misinformation, take the opportunity to kindly educate that person, so then they are armed with the same knowledge.

There are also lots of cute FB videos and now ads that all use baby pigs, instead of full grown pigs, and this also perpetuates the “micro” and “teacup” myth. Another great way to spread knowledge is if you see people sharing these, educate them that those are babies, and that is not the reality of owning a pet pig.
