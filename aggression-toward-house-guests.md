<!-- TITLE: Aggression Toward House Guests -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: By Nikki Ford -->

Pig’s are territorial, and will try to establish their dominance over new people that come to your home. Your house guests need to establish their dominance over your pig, so your pig will stop challenging them.

The best way to do this is to have your guests use a baby gate, a board of some sort, or a big Rubbermaid lid, etc. and do [MTP](http://pigipedia.org/behavior-modification) on your pig when he/she charges at them. They need to push your pig with it until he/she concedes. They might have to do it a few times before your pig backs off. It’s very important that your guest(s) have confidence when they are pushing your pig, and don’t back up at all while they are doing it. It’s so important, because your pig will think they have “won” the dominance battle, if your guest(s) back up.

Just have the board handy for whenever people come over, and have them use it as necessary.

Be consistent and have patience with your pig. It might take a while for them to understand that they don’t have “top hog” over new people that come to their home.
