# Pigs and dogs typically do not mix well in the home.
There are some pigs and dogs that do not mind each other's company and even seem to enjoy each other However, they should NEVER be left alone unsupervised for any length of time, no matter how well they get along. It doesn't matter how well trained the dog is this is nature. Natural Instincts will override the best training at the worst of times. If you aren't there to stop the attack the consequences can be fatal or maiming. It only takes a a seconds for brutal damage to be done to your baby, you can be standing right beside your pig or dog and they can have an fight that changes your pig and/or dogs life forever. Your baby pigs life isn't worth taking that kind of chance in my opinion 
A lot of good dogs have accepted the pig in the home only to turn around and attack week, months, years down the road and really hurt or even kill your pig. Pigs are defenseless against a dog bite and usually the pig starts the fight.

# Pigs are assholes.
They are herd animals and everyone (including the dog) is a part of the herd, so when they think they're on top of their game and challenge everyone to be TOP HOG, it doesn't very often turn out so good. please don't leave them alone, no matter what. It can and does happen even with the most docile, loving dogs. It's just in their DNA. I've seen dogs and pigs get along very well together too and never ever have any issues, but I always like to warn those who don't know pigs all that well. Dogs are PREDITORS and pigs are PREY. This is at the very core of their NATURE. Normal pig behaviors from a pig can trigger that predator instinct in an normally friendly dog. 
It's not the dog's fault, they are only acting on instinct. It doesn't make the dog bad or cruel. It is simply the dogs place in the world as a predator. Dogs and pigs speak completely different languages. This will create r confusion, frustration, and aggression.
Dog families are formed by packs with specific social order, respect, communication, body language. 

# Pigs are herd animals.
Pigs are herd animals with a different social hierarchy. Pigs are continually challenging and reassessing the order of that herd in order to keep the strongest on top, hence TOP HOG, to protect and lead the herd. Typically, the pig starts the fight but the dog finishes it. Pigs have no defense against the jaws and teeth of a dog. It only takes seconds for a dog to tear the ears off the pig and hurt them very badly, a lot of times resulting in the pig's death or 1000's of dollars in vet bills and permanent damage. 
Pigs change a lot in there first five years, their personalities change so the dog knows the pig as a young one personality type of animal and then changes into a different type of animal this confuses the dog and creates agitation and aggression. 
Bottom line no matter if your dog is as sweet as anything nature can and will take over when you least expect it and you could loose your piggie.
