<!-- TITLE: Urinary Tract Infection or U.T.I. -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: By Scott R. Murdock -->

U.T.I. is very common and many times go unnoticed and clear themselves up without intervention. U.T.I. is where a bacterium gets into the urinary tract and causes an infection. If goes undiagnosed and untreated it can evolve into something much worse, a bladder or kidney infection. Swine are prone to get a U.T.I.’s because of their basic anatomy, when a female sits on her bum she exposes her most vulnerable area to bacterium typically from feces in the dirt and can develop into an infection easily as for male pigs because their most vulnerable area is on their belly a male pig lays down onto the ground and can pick up the bacterium very easily as well.

Treatment is typically very successful when a urine sample has been tested and the appropriate antibiotic has been prescribed. Many times, an antibiotic is given but its not the appropriate one for your particular strain and it can mask the problem and you’ll be back to the vet for the same issue. Preventive measures are plenty of fresh water intake to flush out possible bacterium before they become an infection although this will create more frequent urination it does help prevent infection. Plenty of fresh clean water for you pig has a lot of health benefits. If a U.T.I is suspected get a cup or ladle and catch a sample, be sure to seal up in a container as to not allow contamination and bring to a veterinarian for testing for proper antibiotic administration. It is believed by many health professional cranberries and cranberry extract can help prevent U.T.I.’s by simply making the urine more acidic and makes for the bacterial growth harder in an acidic environment. Cranberries are not a cure but maybe a preventative measure to add to your pig’s diet.
