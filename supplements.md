<!-- TITLE: Supplements My Pig Might Need -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Scott R. Murdock -->

Vitamins and supplements will vary from area to area as well as pig to pig. In theory if your pig is getting to eat a good quality pig pellet or feed they should be getting what nutrients they need and getting time to root at least a few times a week. Unfortunately, many vitamins are unstable and can be damaged by the manufacturing process of the feed. I will give you a list of some supplements that are important in my opinion for a healthy pig.

1. Vitamin E.
    Vitamin E is essential for your pig to live a long healthy life. It may be one of the most important supplement you can give, it works in conjunction with selenium to ward off disease. If you give nothing else, vitamin E is very important. Vitamin E is one of the most volatile vitamins and does break down in manufacturing and in storage so even a good feed the Vitamin e can be damaged or lessened in just storage of feed. Recommend not skipping this supplement. Could save your pigs life and a lot of money in vet bills. The safe amount is 400 IU capsule per day without danger of toxicity with maximum benefit. Here are some foods high in vitamin E. Almonds, broccoli, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, avocado, parsley, natural or raw sunflower seeds, spinach, swiss chard, mustard and turnip greens, kale, hazelnuts, pine nuts, papaya, cold pressed and unrefined oils such as coconut oil, olive oil, hemp seed oil, sunflower oil and wheat germ oil.
		 
2. Selenium.
    This is equally as important as vitamin E and works in conjunction with vitamin E to prevent disease. Typically want between 150 to 300 mcg’s per week, once a week. If you are feeding a high-quality feed give this no more than once a week, most good feeds have selenium, but the amount is very hard to quantify due to selenium is absorbed into the plant from the soil and depends on how much selenium is in the soil where the plant was originally grown. Many areas soil are very low in selenium, so the amount of selenium can vary to nonexistent. Selenium can be fatally toxic so no more than 300 mcg’s per week because it is typically unknown how much they get through diet and rooting. You may be able to find your areas soil selenium levels from local agricultural bureaus. 

    Here are some foods that are high in selenium. Barley, broccoli, swiss chard, sunflower and flaxseeds, cabbage, spinach, whole grains, brazil nuts, and seeds. Because its unknown how much any of these plants were able to absorb I recommend add this supplement maximum once a week.
		
3. Coconut Oil.
    Jury is still out on this one, most studies are inconclusive. Many cultures support the use of coconut oil, but evidence is not completely scientifically supported yet. There are studies that show many benefits from the use of coconut oil. Cultures that use coconut oil as a main part of diet appear younger and are healthier in general. There have been no reports of health problems in the moderate use of coconut oil for extended periods of time. Up side of coconut use with your pig, it can be used topically or internally for dry skin. Coconut oil is rich in omega’s 6 and 9. It’s a saturated fat and high in calories, about 120 calories per tablespoon and is metabolized at a much higher rate than animal fats, since it metabolizes at a much faster rate it’s a quick source of energy compared to animal fats, as a saturated fat it can cause an increase in LDL the bad cholesterol.
		Plant based oils like olive oil or flaxseed oil are scientifically proven better fat and are a lot less expensive than coconut oil. Some of the good that coconut oil brings is its antimicrobial benefit and its antioxidant benefit. There are claims of weight loss and metabolism boosts, but these claims have not been substantially verified. There are refined and unrefined versions of coconut oil too. Refined coconut oil is exposed to very high heat during the extraction process and does damage to some of the health benefits. Unrefined will be less clean and may have dust and other unwanted particles in it. You must read up on the different oils and make the best decision you can for you and your pig. Many owners will make a frozen treat from coconut oil for dry skin issues other will use as a topical.
		I am not a fan of any topicals on a pig as the oil and dirt can clog pores, I’ve found a good diet will help most pigs with dry skin issues, if you have an extreme case of dry skin and diet isn’t working then tropical might be the way for you to go. If you are fighting weight issues with your pig then coconut oil may exasperate that situation and I would recommend cutting out or back substantially. Overweight for your pig is more dangerous than the few health benefits from coconut oil. Coconut oil has very few nutrients and you wouldn’t be missing anything vital if in an overweight situation by cutting it out.

4. A.C.V. or Organic Apple Cider Vinegar with the mother. 
    This is a supplement that I am a big fan of using. The benefits are amazing for your pig. Although not a necessary supplement it is a great benefit to most pigs. Like coconut oil its benefit have not been fully substantiated. I will say I’ve witness the benefits and do recommend adding to you pigs diet after about 8 weeks of age at the rate of 1 to 1.25 TSP per 25 pounds of pig per day in your pig’s meal. Most pigs love the taste, so it typically will be welcomed by your pig in his or her meals. The benefits although many have not been fully proven may include:
		
	* New Zealand trials show that the daily supplement of ACV to sows prior to farrowing and during weaning resulted in the elimination of mastitis in sows, major reduction of scouring in piglets, and some increase in litter size. 
	* Relief in constipation
	* Supports healthy urinary tract 
	* Supports immune system
	* Supports natural body functions
	* Promotes healthy digestion
	* Promotes body PH balance 
	* Helps with dry skin issues
	* Supports healthy gut bacteria 
	* High in potassium
	* Supports increase in absorption of essential nutrients in feed 
	* Small to medium reduction in feed due to increase in nutrient absorption
	* Reduction or elimination in most parasites
	* Helps with scours or loose stool
	* Help stabilize blood sugar levels 
	* Helps with coat quality due to better nutrient absorption
	* Help prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and viruses in the digestive tract
	* (External use) soothes sunburn and insect bites 
	* (External use) Insect repellant

    When using A.C.V. you will want to make sure you are getting the real stuff. Be careful in the store you can find apple cider “flavored” vinegar, not going to help you as much, you want organic with the mother, apple cider vinegar. The mother is the good parts of the apple left behind, lets you know it’s unfiltered. Good for you too, always check with your doctor before use. Don’t think using more will help stick with the dosage unless told different by a medical professional. 
Too much A.C.V. may result in tooth enamel damage, upset stomach, potassium loss, burn to the throat if used in excess. Feel free to search out apple cider vinegar benefits, you will be amazed.

5. Fish Oil.
    A typically healthy adult pig can have 100-150 mgs EPA and DHA per every ten pounds of pig daily. If your pig has arthritis or other ailments your veterinarian may increase to 300 mgs. 
You are looking for just fish oil no additional ingredients. Not looking for burpless or any other ingredient. Fish oil supports healthy heart and help support the immune system adds omega 3 to your pig’s diet has been beneficial for many pigs. Generally, you will use the omega 3 total for your dosing. Most pills are between 300-375 omega 3, watch how many pills in a dose so you don’t over or under dose your pig. When introducing oils, do this slowly over a week or so. Introduction of oil can cause diarrhea if done too quickly, work up to it, let your pig get use to the oil in his or her diet. There are also oils in bulk form that can be used from a pump or pour.

6. Iron.
    Iron is very important for piglets and many recommend an iron shot within the first two to three weeks, I recommend consulting with a porcine veterinarian if you are farrowing or talk with someone or multiple people who raise pigs for the best recommendation for your situation. Most pigs will get all the iron they need from rooting in the soil. An iron supplement is NOT necessary for an adult pig that gets plenty of time to root, now if you have a strictly indoor pig who never gets to root iron maybe something you need to supplement. Most good feeds have iron but the best place for your pig to get the mineral is absorption through the snout by rooting or in plants high in iron. No need to give an iron supplement pill, in fact in can do more harm than good if your pig gets too much iron. Some food high in iron are:
		* Spinach
		* Most dark leafy greens
		* Beans (lima beans, red kidney beans)
		* Chickpeas
		* Split peas
		* Some breakfast cereals enriched with iron (watch sugar and salt/sodium content)
		* Wheat germ
		* Rice
		* Sunflower seeds
		* Nuts like peanuts, pecans, walnuts, pistachios, almonds, and cashews.
		 
		(All beans and legumes and some nuts should be cooked or may be toxic or worse), with no salt/sodium added not raw from the plant, see toxic foods later in this book on what foods to avoid.

7. Biotin.
    Biotin is a B vitamin and a coenzyme that helps with hair, skin and hoof growth. Biotin absorption can be challenging for pigs so if your pigs hooves are brittle and/or cracking or your pigs hair is brittle and breaks off biotin may help with healthier hair, skin and hooves new growth. 1000 mcg’s per day is all that is required and give in feed in pill form. Stay away from gummies as gummies are typically pork products that are used to create gelatin.

8. Pumpkin canned or fresh.
    As a pig parent it is a good idea to keep a few cans of pure pumpkin around the house (not pie filling, 100% pure pumpkin). It works to bulk and bind food so helps with either diarrhea or constipation. Very low calorie so doesn’t pose a weight gain issue fed in moderation. 
		Typically give my pigs a quarter to half a can at a serving. Most pigs love pumpkin. 100 grams of pumpkin is only 26 calories so great treat too and a great way to hide wormer or medication. You can feed all of a fresh pumpkin to your pig including rind, seeds, meat, no stem (choking hazard).
