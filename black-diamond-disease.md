# Erysipelas or Black Diamond Disease

Erysipelas in pigs is caused by bacterium clinical name Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiaeand it is believed that almost 50 percent of all farm swine carry this bacterium but don’t show acute signs. The bacterium lives in the soil as well so if your area gets infected it is hard to ever get rid of the bacterium completely. This is a treatable disease when caught early, problem is pigs don’t always show acute signs until the disease has progressed so when signs present themselves don’t waste time get in touch with a veterinarian to administer the appropriate antibiotic. You know your pig better than anyone else so just watch them. If they don’t do their regular schedule of things like get up when you do, run around the yard like normal, anything at all out of the usual behavior is worth a physical and visual once over check. Pigs being prey animal have learned to never show weakness or be eaten so they will mask most illness until they can’t any more, so be mindful of your pigs typical behaviors. Anything out of the ordinary you should be checking for sores, successful bowel movements, uneventful urinations, normal sleep and eating patterns, joint pain, hard to get up and down, labored walking etc. If behavior is untypical, time for a quick once over on your pig and anything doesn’t seem right either watch for other signs or call the vet depending what you find. 

This disease can be acute, sub acute or chronic, typically in mini pigs we will be talking about acute and sub acute, chronic is typically found in large groups of pigs like farm pigs and the disease may be present in a pig without physical signs and turn acute and the only indication is death. In cases like this the whole farm needs to be sterilized to get rid of the disease because the disease can and will live in the soil and in the tonsils of other pigs and continue to cause chronic problems. Acute and sub acute are more prevalent in mini pigs living in a home. The signs of this disease are stiffness of joints, no appetite, lethargic, temperatures 102 to 108, diamond shaped lesion that may ulcerate, sow aborting litter, stillborn. Sometimes the diamond shape lesions are easier to feel than to see early into the onset of disease.

The disease will typically show signs within 72 hours of bacterium exposure. The disease is believed to survive in soil for up to six months and be resistant to high and low temperature. Birds and rodents will infect feed and watering systems as well as soil. Time is of the essence when the you suspect that the disease is present. If the disease is responded to early enough the chance of full recovery is high. The disease responds to penicillin very well. If you live in an area where the disease is more prevalent it’s a good idea to have penicillin on hand and learn how to give an injection to a pig. There is a vaccine that works on the three most common strains. The vaccine is administered twice a year at six-month intervals. There are approximately 15 strains that affect pigs, so the vaccine is somewhat helpful and may lessen the effects but won’t guarantee not getting infected.

Best practice is to check your pig every day for abnormalities, rub all over the body and feel for bumps, lumps or any abnormalities, check ears, eyes, hooves, legs, back etc. anything found abnormal call your veterinarian for advice and an appointment as soon as possible, time is of the essence if it is black diamond disease. Photos can be helpful if lesions are physically apparent for the vet. Please note all symptoms your pig is displaying for the vet before calling, this will help with diagnosis. Earlier detection, higher mortality rate. After detection and the lesions start to heal they will become crusty and scabbed, this is normal. You must keep these areas clean and dry to prevent a secondary infection. May apply a good antibacterial (Vetericyn) to help prevent future infection. Always check with your vet for the best practice for your situation.

# Some of the know causes and contributing factors of Erysipelas
* Dirty, wet pig pens (clean out sleeping and living areas routinely) 
* Overcrowding in a pig habitat
* Non-sanitized wet feeding systems (especially when milk products are used)
* Feces in feeding area
* Sudden changes in diet
* Sudden changes in weather
* Infection from a pig not showing physical signs.
* Infected bird droppings in soil
* Exposure to infected animals
