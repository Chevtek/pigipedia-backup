<!-- TITLE: Salt Toxicity And Water Deprivation -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Salt poisining is very dangerous for your pig and constant access to water is extremely important. -->

### Lets first break down salt and sodium.

When looking at salt levels you also need to look at sodium although they are not the same all salt has sodium but not all sodium is salt. Salt is 40 percent sodium and 60 percent chloride. You or your pig can not live without the mineral sodium. It is the amount of salt/sodium and the availability of water is what creates the deadly issues. Avoiding foods high in salt/sodium is a good idea but what is possibly more important is the availability for your pig to get fresh water all the time. Water deprivation causes more salt toxicity than foods high in salt/sodium. This is very important and needs to be tended to all the time, make sure fresh water is always available for your pig. Pig will many times forgo drinking water if it's old, contaminated with debris, hot from the sun, biofilm covered, green growth on bottom of water container. Make sure fresh water is plentiful all the time. This is where salt poisoning arises from most of the time. A pig gets into some dog food (typically very high in sodium) and fresh water isn’t available then things start to go very wrong after 24 hours of water deprivation symptoms can set in.

Many that get salt poisoning don’t recover and if they do recover, full recovery is sometimes never achieved. Many times, pigs with salt toxicity that make it through have brain damage. Salt or sodium does not need to be removed from your pig’s diet but does need to be monitored for over use. Typically, salt poisoning occurs when a pig gets into a salt/sodium item and no or poor access to fresh water or can occur with just lack of fresh water for 36-48 hour with normal safe salt levels in diet. The higher the sodium levels in the blood the less time before poisoning takes place. So, key is fresh water all the time. If you suspect salt/sodium poisoning from a high salt/sodium source and it has been ingested call your veterinarian immediately. If the ingestion of a heavily salted meal as in dog or cat food, a bag of potato chips, many cereals, a lot of cereals are made with baking soda, baking soda is extremely high in sodium. If consumption has taken place within about 6 hours or less and signs of salt toxicity is not present, then induce vomiting if possible and call vet as soon as possible.

### If physical signs of toxicity are present do not induce vomiting.

They can aspirate and create even more potentially fatal issues for your pig. Salt toxicity is suspected with no signs showing for an adult pig give no more than two cups of plain water then give a mixture of water and 50/50 Gatorade or I prefer Pedialyte as much as they want to drink until you get to the veterinary hospital then they will check blood sodium levels and detox your pig from there. The process of detoxing is checking your pig for sodium levels in blood and will slowly bring the blood sodium level down over a multi-day period until at a safe level and toxicity is no longer evident. Many pigs will not survive, but sooner you can get to a veterinarian the better chance at survival and full recovery. If your pig does survive there is a high chance of brain damage that can make the pig seem like a stranger and may have a hard time interacting and bonding with you, possibly will be a very lethargic pig for the rest of their life.

### Symptoms of salt poisoning

* First symptom is lack of appetite (no interest in food)
* Moving their head in and out like a turtle
* Possible blindness
* Staggering around as if drunk
* Inability to walk in a straight line without stumbling
* Running into walls and front legs collapsing
* Lethargic
* Sometimes a pig will place their snout against the wall as if holding themselves up, then begin to sway.
 
A pig typically will not have a fever with salt toxicity. If your pig is running a fever may not be salt toxicity and could be some other illness or disease.
