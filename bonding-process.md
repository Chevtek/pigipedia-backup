<!-- TITLE: The Bonding Process -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: By Scott R. Murdock -->

Let’s talk about the bonding process. This is very important for training and a well adjusted pig. 
If you can’t give the necessary time and put the effort in you will be a VERY frustrated pig parent. 
Pigs look at you as their parent, leader, protector and source for food. Don’t let them down. Watch them closely, you can learn what your pig is saying to you. They speak English much better than we do pigs. You can learn pig as long as you pay attention. Let me give you a for instance both of my pigs have figured out how to push open a door but they dont close it yet, so they have a dog door and that’s what they are suppose to use. Both will go to the door with me sitting there. All I say is Gemma or Tara please use your door and they will Change course and go through the correct door with nothing but speaking to them. 
This all stems from the bonding process in My opinion.
