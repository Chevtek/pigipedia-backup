<!-- TITLE: Reasons To NOT Get A Pig -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: By Scott R. Murdock -->

# Considering getting a pig Everyone will tell you why, here is why not.

* If you are not willing to commit to this animal for its entire life (15-20 years).
* If you cannot put the necessary time to train and bond with this pig. 
* If you are not willing to learn and apply.
* If you are not ready for a toddler running around your house for the next 15-20 years that does not understand English fully.
* If you live in an apartment.
* If you live in a house that has no outside area to root and play.
* If you are not prepared for your pig to possibly be over 200 pounds.
* If you plan or a there is a chance you might move into an apartment. (very difficult to find landlords willing to have a pig)
* If you are not willing to set aside at least $1000 for an emergency medical fund or have credit available or both. Pet insurance is sometimes an option. 
* If you are not financially liquid enough to get your pig altered within a couple of months or when they are physically ready.
* If you have a dog or dogs and are not willing to keep them separate.
* If you are not willing to be coachable and learn different teaching techniques. 
* If your boyfriend or girlfriend or spouse doesn’t like pigs.
* If you will get mad when the yard is rooted up.
* If you are not ready to get snout dirt on your work clothes as you are on your way to work.
* If you’re going to lose your mind when your pig decides walls are his or her new treat.
* If you are not willing to get your pig spayed or neutered.
* Ok with restricted or limited vacations unless you have a friend or family member that is familiar with pigs and a person the pig is familiar with as well that is willing to stay with them while you are away. This can cause much stress for your pig and would recommend facetime or Skype with your pig. Pigs are highly social and emotional, their family away is very stressful for them. 
* If you’re starting a new family with children. This may be too much with a small child because a pig isn’t much different than a toddler.
* If you have not checked out your local zoning laws. Many communities consider mini pigs livestock. If a clerk at the city or your HOA say its ok to have a pig, GET IT OFFICIALLY IN WRITING. This is very common, please don’t overlook. County, City and HOA rules change all the time and if you don’t have something in writing they can force you to leave or get rid of your pig. If you have something official in writing many times you will be grandfathered in.
* If you are unable to give your pig 4-6 hours minimum of interaction from some family member. A pig locked up in a kennel is not the way to be a successful parent. Pigs don’t do very well for extended periods without interaction. Pigs are highly social.
* If you are not prepared to be yelled at until you train to do otherwise.
* If you are old or infirmed may not be the correct pet for you. Pigs keep you on your toes.
* If you are not prepared to take advice and apply for your pig.
* This animal will need you and demand time from you. If you can’t give what your pig needs, do not get a pig, PLEASE!
* A pig is not like owning a cat or dog, they take much more knowledge, time, effort, reading, conversations with other pig parents, money, room. 
* If any or all the above apply a fish is your best bet for your next pet.
* Feeding a pig properly can cost approximately $50-$150 a month, depending on your resources and area you live in. If you choose to go with a better grade of feed and supplements, then the upper end of the money scale is what you are looking toward. I’m at the local grocery store at least once a week picking up all sorts of fresh and frozen veggies, fruit and supplements for the pigs. If you give quality feed and supplements to your pig, long term veterinary cost will typically be substantially less. 
* If you are not prepared to keep on a schedule within a half hour for your pig. Pigs thrive under structure without change. They demand and function much better on a strict schedule. 
* If you like to move furniture around all the time, then your pig will be agitated a lot. Pigs HATE change, period. If you make changes in your home or schedule, then your pig can and will typically act out. Patience and understanding is paramount. 
* There are zero short cuts with owning and raising a pet pig. Only love, knowledge, patience and persistence.
