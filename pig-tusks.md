<!-- TITLE: Pig Tusks -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: By Nikki Ford -->

**I wanted to address a few common questions pig parents have in regards to their pig's tusks.**

---

### Do male and females both get tusks?
Yes, they both grow tusks. Males are a little bit more prominent than females.<!--, as you can see on the diagram.-->

### When will my pig grow tusks?
Every pig is different, but usually around 1 and half to 2 years is when you start noticing them.

### Can I get my pig's tusks removed?
It is HIGHLY discouraged. Why? Other tusked  animals, like elephants, have a separate cavity for their tusks, while pig's do not. Their tusks are actually part of their jaw, this makes removing them very risky, because there is a chance of the vet breaking their jaw during the surgery, and if that doesn't happen, the pig's jaw will be weaker afterwards, which has a high risk of breaks and infection. 

### What is a safer alternative to tusk removal?
Trimming them down. You can get their tusks trimmed at the same time you trim their hooves.

### How often do I have to get them trimmed?
Pig tusks grow relatively slow, so you don't need to trim them nearly as often as their hooves. 

### Do I have to get my pig's tusks trimmed?
Not at all. Some people choose not to have their pig's tusks trimmed. It just depends on the pig, their living situation, and how comfortable the pig parent's are with their pig having tusks or not.
